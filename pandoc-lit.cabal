Version:         0.3
Synopsis:        Literate programming with pandoc and lhs2tex
Description:     pandoc-lit supports literate programming by
                 combining two excellent tools: pandoc for text
                 processing, and lhs2tex for source code
                 formatting. pandoc-lit's input files are written
                 in markdown+lhs, and its output is LaTeX code
                 ready to be processed by lhs2tex.
                 .
                 I use pandoc-lit to write research papers and
                 prepare presentation slides, and I plan to use
                 it for my Ph.D. thesis. It has been used by a
                 colleague to prepare a presentation, so it runs
                 one computers other than mine, too. So while I
                 think it is quite usable already, it is by no
                 means stable, and currently, using it
                 essentially requires some amount of hacking on
                 it.
                 .
                 At the Haskell Implementor's Workshop 2010, I
                 gave a lightning talk about pandoc-lit, which
                 has been videotaped and is available on the web.
